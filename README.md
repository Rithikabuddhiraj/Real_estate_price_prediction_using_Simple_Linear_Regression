# 🏠 Real Estate Price Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to use **Simple Linear Regression** to predict **real estate prices** based on features such as the area of the property.

---

## 📌 Objective

To build a simple machine learning model that predicts the price of a property using only one independent variable — **Area (square feet)**.

- `Real_Estate_Price_Prediction.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Data loading and visualization
  - Simple Linear Regression model training
  - Model prediction
  - Plotting regression line and evaluation

## 📈 What is Simple Linear Regression?

**Simple Linear Regression** is a statistical method that models the relationship between:
- One **independent variable (X)** – Area
- One **dependent variable (Y)** – Price

The model tries to find the best-fit line:
